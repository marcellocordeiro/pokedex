# pokedex

This project is an experimental Pokédex for learning purposes. It's written in TypeScript using React, Tailwind CSS and Next.js, fetching data from [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). The goals for this project are to learn how to take advantage of [SSG](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/overview) from Next.js and also build a project with good practices and using cutting/bleeding-edge technology.

## Features

- [x] Overview page
- [x] Pokémon details page
- [x] Static-site generation (limited, will generate more pages on-demand)
- [ ] Storybook to view components
- [ ] Tests
- [x] Really badly designed components, or rather the lack of any design...
- [ ] The previous item will be addressed soon, this is a very early project that is still building its foundations

## Getting Started

Install the node modules and start the development server with these commands:

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to start the application.

## todo

- Storybook
- Overview pagination
- Show pokémon thumbnail in the home page with its English name
- I can't fit everything that comes to mind here, consider that nothing has been done yet :(
